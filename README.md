# ipop-on-docker

The folder IPOP contains items that are needed to set up an IPOP base image. It is possible to select a specific Release of IPOP and the script can then select the appropriate tarball to ultimately containerize IPOP for Docker.

The IPOPLocal folder works a little differently. Since IPOP needs to be configured specifically for each node, the contents of this folder allow you to add the configuration parameters that you desire while keeping them private to your node. Essentially, the contents are defaults and you may edit them locally.

More instructions to come as feedback is provided.
